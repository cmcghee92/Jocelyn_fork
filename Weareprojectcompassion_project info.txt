https://weareprojectcompassion.org/
Pulled the paypal donation transaction log I removed and replace real donor data (name, phone number and emails) with 38 names of movie characters, and music artists from the 90s.  They were given fake addresses and donation amounts and donation dates.

Project A: 
Step 1: Prepare the environment
In a AZ-400 Lab Create a Donor OU and create AD Users in the Donor OU with name, email, and addresses. 

Step 2: 
Use Powershell to create a CSV file containing donor names and addresses (use fake info), create a powershell script to pull the Donor name and mailing address from AD DS (Donor OU)

Step 3: Autogenerate custom letter promoting current donation campaign

Create a script to autogenerate a custom letter that will be printed and mailed.  Letter includes personalized info with donor mailing address and name notifying the donor of the current campaign to collect funds for a children's hospital in Lima, Peru.  

Project B: Analyze Paypal donation data
Given a csv file containint donation data for a period of time, create a powershell script that will analyze the data trends by visually displaying charts and graph
