Create/update README.md

Project A. Given a CSV file containing donor names/emails (use fake info), create a powershell script to autogenerate a thank you email
Pull Donor information from paypal or donation platform.  For practice and knowledge only.  Do NOT use or post real Donor information on this project!  I will be inserting fake donor names and emails (from the AZ-0400 Lab I will use Users in the Contoso.com domain)
-Using the file as a template (header information).  Create a csv, file using the same header format and insert your list of donors.
-Write a script to pull AD users from AZ-0400 Lab, pull 10 sample users
Create a powershell script that will autogenerate a thank you email to each donor by name, their donation amount and the donation date.  
If able to add a script to also auto email it out.


Project B.  Given a CSV file containing donation amounts from the start of using the donation platform.
